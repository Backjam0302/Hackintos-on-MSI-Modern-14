# Hackintos-on-MSI-Modern-14
Run MacOS Catalina on MSI Modern 14 I7-10510u and Intel UHD graphics (I don't know if this work for laptop with dedicated GPU)

Sorry for my bad english...

I recently managed to install macOS catalina on Modern 14 with everything stock. Since I couldn't find anyone on the internet who shared their EFI folder, I decided to share mine.
What I managed to get is a semi-perfect working PC: wifi, bluetooth (more or less), the trackpad supports gestures (even if the scroll is a bit too slow), USB, Intel UHD graphics acceleration, HDMI, percentage battery, shortcuts to change volume and brightness, webcam and microphone.

To make the audio work from both the speaker and the headphone jack, the wifi and bluetooth have shown problems. I managed to get it to work by installing HeliPort, but the performance is not the best (download speed not at maximum and the PC does not connect to the wifi on startup).

Some things aren't perfect but it's my first experience with a Hackintosh. If maybe someone more experienced would like to contribute it would be appreciated :)

I leave you a .txt file with the link of the EFI folder (files are too much for github)
